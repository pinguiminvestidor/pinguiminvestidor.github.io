# "Build" static html pages by sandwiching the markdown content with the two
# template halves, and save the output to a given page. The <title> attribute
# will be the first "H1" you find in the .md document.
# 
# Requires the Markdown Perl script (https://daringfireball.net/markdown) or
# similar implementation to perform this wonderful hack. 
# But, yes, a hack indeed. Why aren't you using a CMS, man...
#
# USAGE: just run ./pagebuilder and let it work its magic. It'll look for all
# *.md files in the directory, sandwich their HTML equivalent along the
# templates and save the content as a new .html file, which can be rendered.
